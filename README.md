### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently doing my masters in Quantum Computing at [IISc, Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science).
- 🌱 My current interest is in Quantum Algorithms and their applications in Deep learning, optimization and system simulation. I also keep track of developments in Quantum (Post-Quantum) Cryptography and Quantum error corrections.
- :dart: One of the long-term goals is to understand the power and limitations of the computational complexity class BQP, i.e., the set of problems having a polynomial time Quantum algorithm.

- Some open problems in Quantum Complexity theory:
  
  $P\neq BQP$: The conjecture is Quantumness adds power to computation. But there is still no proof for it.

  $BQP\not\subset NP:$ The conjecture is the power of a Quantum Turing machine (QTM) and a non-determinism Turing Machine(NTM) is incomparable. It is still unknown if there exists a real problem that could be solved by QTM but not by NTM. While it is known that such a problem does exist in a relativised setting, i.e., the Black-box model of computation.
