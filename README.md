### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 Currently, I’m doing my masters in Quantum Computing at [IISc, Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science).
- 🌱 My current interest is in Quantum Algorithms and their applications in Deep learning, optimization and system simulation. I also keep track of developments in Quantum (Post-Quantum) Cryptography and Quantum error corrections.
- :dart: One of the long-term goals is to understand the power and limitations of the computational complexity class BQP, i.e., the set of problems having a polynomial time Quantum algorithm.
- Some Open problems in Quantum Complexity theory:
  
  > $P\neq BQP:$ It is conjecture that Qauntumess add power to computation. Still, there is no formal proof for it.

  > $BQP\not\subset NP$: It is conjectured that the power of Quantum Turing Machine and Non-deterministic Turing Machine are not comparable. It is known to hold true in the oracle/relativized model. Still, there is no real-world problem to separate these classes.
  
- ⭐ A part-time programmer. Trying to learn a bit of creative thinking via Dynamic Programming [😅].
